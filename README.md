# Grocery-Tracking-Program-SNHU
This is a grocery tracking software that I made for my C++ class. This software creates a frequency tables of the purchase of items collected. The algorithim first collects data from the input file, and then creates a frequency tables of each item, and the times at which they are received. It sorts the items based on order. 
I believe that I used the knowledge given to me in this course and applied it to this project very well. I could enhance the code by integrating the two files together, but I did not have time for the deadline which is the honest truth. I will go back and fix this bug. I can improve the in line comments, because I did not add any. I found that making the code work together was the most challenging issue I had. I can use the algorithims I used in other projects. I now know that C++ and Python can be combined to create a more useful software.
